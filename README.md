# ðŸš€ Subsets with Bounded Shortest Paths (Floyd-Warshall Approach)

This repository contains an efficient C++ solution to count the number of subsets of nodes in a graph such that **all pairs of nodes within the subset have a shortest path distance â‰¤ `maxDistance`**. The approach uses the **Floyd-Warshall algorithm** for all-pairs shortest paths within each subset.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Problem Statement

Given:
- An integer `n` (number of nodes, labeled from `0` to `n-1`)
- A list of bidirectional roads `roads[i] = [u, v, distance]`
- An integer `maxDistance`

Return the number of subsets (including empty and singleton sets) of the nodes such that for **every pair of nodes** in the subset, the **shortest distance between them does not exceed `maxDistance`**.

---

## ðŸ’¡ Approach

For each subset of the nodes:
1. Build a subgraph using only the nodes in the subset and roads between them.
2. Use **Floyd-Warshall** to compute all-pairs shortest paths.
3. Check if all distances in this subset are â‰¤ `maxDistance`.
4. Count it if valid.

Optimizations:
- Skip Floyd-Warshall if the subset is empty or has only one node (always valid).
- Avoid unnecessary recomputation of indices by mapping node labels to matrix indices.

maxDistance = 4

Output:
